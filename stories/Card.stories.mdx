# Card

The card will be used as a general interface to provide general structure to a UI component.
It comes with very basic styling, but has a ton of customization. It includes options for headers and footers.
The card component is made in such a way that it can be used as a container for other components.

## Table of Contents

In this documentation we talk in depth about `Card` component, it's functionality, usag and props.

## Functionality

Cards can be used as a container for other components. Think of it as a
blank canvas with posibilities to add almost anything you like. So the way to use a card is to wrap
it around any component that you want to display inside the card. You can choose to have a card with a `Header`
then a body and then a `Footer`.

Here is a simple example of how to use a card.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Complete Card">
        {CompleteCard.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

That's it we have a card with a `Header` and a `Footer` and it look great :)
But what if you want to customize the card?
No issues at all, you can customize the card and the components inside it as you wish.

Let's customize this card to make  it look more elegent.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Custom Card">
        {CustomCard.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Setup

To Setup these cards are very simple, these cards are very similar to the HTML `<div>` element. 
The main purpose of a card is to provide information about a single piece of information.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Standard Card" args={{ children: "This is card component" }}>
		{StandardCard.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### `Card` with `Header`

Since the card component works as a container for other components, 
you add a `Header` component to it which will work as a title for your content in the body.
If you are going with a `Header` component, it's worth mentioning
that `Header` will always be on top of the rest of the children component.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Card With Header">
        {CardWithHeader.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### `Card` with `Footer`

What if you want to add a foot note or a link to the main content? well you can do that
by adding a `Footer` component to the card. A cool thing to remember is that `Footer` will always be on the bottom of the card.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Card With Footer">
        {CardWithFooter.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

For a full breakdown of all the additional props, refer to the table below. Also take into
consideration that this card component works like a normal HTML `div`, and can be customized like one.
