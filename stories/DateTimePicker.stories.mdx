# DatePicker

The DatePicker component is a wrapper around the `react-datepicker` library. It works to provide a simple date picker.
With The DatePicker allows users to enter a date either through text input, or by choosing a date from the calendar.
With our custom props you can customize a lot of the look and feel of the DatePicker as well as functionality.

## Functionality
