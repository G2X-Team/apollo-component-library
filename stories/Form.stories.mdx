# Form

The Form component is in charge of all form validation needs in the Apollo compoent library. It is
a pretty major component in functionally setting up performant forms with your choice of validation.
Our client side validation is brought to you by `remix-hook-form`.

## References

Here is a list of components you should check out to get started with the form:

## Functionality

Here we'll go more in depth of how you can use Apollo's Form component to the form you need.

### `client` Form

The client-side form is probably the most familiar type of form in its implementation if you have
previous experience dealing with validation in React. At this point you're probably thinking: "ugh,
these guys probably added extra steps to creating a form by making me use their wrapper, right?"
**Wrong!** We took the time to abstract the user from any painful state declarations and arbitrary
form setup by handling that logic ourselves under the hood.

#### Submission & Failure

Before we go into the validation, we'll explain the different functions that the form will call
when you attempt to submit a form.

-   `onSubmit` will be called when you submit a valid form
-   `onError` will be called when you submit an invalid form

#### `onSubmit`

For the `onSubmit` the `data` object is your gateway to all values in the form. As you can tell
from the function, we use `.text` to get the text input's data. Here is a reference for what
each extension will extract:

```typescript
// input data
export type FormGroupData = { radio?: string; checkbox?: string[] };
export type FormTextData = { text?: string };
export type FormToggleData = { checked?: boolean };

// global input type
export type FormInputData = FormGroupData & FormToggleData & FormTextData;

// parameter data
export type FormData = {
    [fieldName: string]: FormInputData;
};
```

Or you can just import the `FormSubmitHandler` from Apollo and use auto-complete to help you out :)

```typescript
/**
 * Method that allows user to view collected form data represented as an object when handling
 * valid submissions
 *
 * @param data information collected from all form inputs
 */
export type FormSubmitHandler = (data: FormData) => void;
```

#### `onError`

The `onError` function is called when the form is invalid. It's called with the error message
structured as on object with the key being the name of the input field, and the value being the
message itself.

```typescript
// parameter data
export type FormErrors = {
    [fieldName: string]: {
        message?: string;
        ref?: any;
        type?: string;
    };
};
```

Or, again you can just import the `FormSubmitHandler` from Apollo and use auto-complete to help you
out :)

```typescript
/**
 * Method that allows user to see all error messages when there is an invalid submission
 *
 * @param errors error messages collected from all inputs
 */
export type FormErrorHandler = (errors: FormErrors) => void;
```

#### Basic Implementation

If you want to create a form and keep see the values, just put the inputs you want from Apollo, 
and we'll track the changes magically without you worrying about the rest. Here we'll show you all 
the inputs in one form and when you submit, you should see all the submit data.

> **Fair warning:** This component will throw if you try to use inputs that don't give them names,
> it's kind of important that you do so that we can register them in our Form :)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Basic Form">
        {BasicForm.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Validation

That's cool and all, but how do you add validation? It's pretty easy, just add a `validator` function!
A `validator` function is a function that takes in the data and returns a string or null value. If
the string is not null, it will be displayed in the form in the shape of an error message. Else,
the form will be considered valid. When the form is valid and submitted, the `onSubmit` function
will be called. Else, the form will not be submitted and the `onError` function will be called.
If you want some nicer auto-complete though you should import the `FormValidator` and use it in the
validator function.

> **Note:** If you want to be more specific with the `FormValidator` you can even add an input
> type that can be imported from Apollo.
>
> -   example: `const validate: FormValidator<FormTextData> = (input) => ...`

```typescript
/**
 * Validates the form
 *
 * @param input: object containing all form input data
 * @returns string or null
 */
const validate: FormValidator = (input) =>
    input?.text.length < 5 && 'Text input must be at least 5 characters long';
```

Almost all input components in Apollo support `validator` functions, all you have to do is put in
the function in the `validator` prop of the component you want to validate, and you're good to go.

> **Note:** The exception to this rule is the `Switch` component, which does not support a
> `validator` function due to accessibility concerns.

    <Story name="Validated Form">
        {ValidatedForm.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### `remix` Form

The `remix` form is pretty much your standard form with a few extra features. It's built on top of
the `ActionData` object you would provide for your typical `remix` validation route. The nice thing
about this form is that it will automatically display any errors or default values for you as shown
in the example below.

Given we have this `ActionData` object:

```typescript
const actionData: ActionData = {
    fields: {
        username: 'john-cena',
        password: 'youcantseeme',
        rating: '1',
        options: ['1', '2'],
        radio: true,
        checkbox: true,
        switch: true,
    },
};
```

We can use the `remix` form like this:

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Remix Form"
        args={{
            type: 'remix',
            actionData: {
                fields: {
                    username: 'john-cena',
                    password: 'youcantseeme',
                    rating: '1',
                    options: ['1', '2'],
                    radio: true,
                    checkbox: true,
                    switch: true,
                },
            },
        }}
    >
        {RemixForm.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

As you can see, all the data from the `ActionData` object is automatically displayed in the form.
All with very little code to write. This `type` of form will be most useful if you want to handle
all validation server-side instead of client-side.

## Other Props & Functionalities

We pretty much covered all the functionality of the `Form` component in the above examples. But
