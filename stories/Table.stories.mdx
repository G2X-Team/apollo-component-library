# Table

The `Table component` is one of the most important components in the UI. It is used to display data in a Table format.
We have designed our `Table component` to be flexible and easy to use, and with a lot of options to customize it.

We made sure that it comes with advance features like sorting, pagination, and many more out of the box.

    - [Pagination](#pagination)

- [Other Props & Functionalities](#other-props--functionalities)

## Functionality

The `Table component` comes packed with a lot of functionalities to help you display data in a better way.
There are a lot of props as well that can we used to customize it.

Let us start by loding a standard Table.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Table" args={{ data: [
            { id: 12, name: 'Harry', Age: 17 },
            { id: 2, name: 'Ron', Age: 18 },
            { id: 1, name: 'Hermione', Age: 18 },
        ] }}>
        {StandardTable.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

In the Table loaded above you can notice that we have used `data` prop which accepts `json` data.
This data will be displayed in the Table.

### Pagination

Now let's see what happens when we increase the number of rows and use the `pageSize` prop.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Table With Pagination" args={{ data: [
            { id: 12, name: 'Harry', Age: 17 },
            { id: 2, name: 'Ron', Age: 18 },
            { id: 1, name: 'Hermione', Age: 18 },
            { id: 14, name: 'Ginny', Age: 17 },
            { id: 15, name: 'Luna', Age: 15 },
            { id: 16, name: 'Sirius', Age: 35 },
            { id: 17, name: 'Hagrid', Age: 80 },
            { id: 18, name: 'Albus', Age: 116 },
        ], pageSize: "5" }}>
        {TableWithPagination.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

As you can notice in the above example we have just increased the `data` in the Table by adding a
5 more rows and it automatically added pagination to the Table. This happened because we are using
the `pageSize` prop with a value of `5`, this means that only 5 rows will be displayed in a one page of the
Table and if the data exceeds that value then a new page will appear in the Table showing the rest of the data. Pretty cool huh?


### Customizing Tables

Now let's look at a more customized Table. There are many props given that can be used to customize the Table. Let's look at them first.

- `width`: This prop defines the width of the Table. The default is `100%`.
- `height`: This prop defines the height of the Table. The default is `100%`.
- `cellTextColor`: This prop defines the text color of the Table cells. The default is `black`.
- `cellTextTransform`: This prop defines the text transform of the Table cells. The default is `capitalize`.
- `cellTextFontWeight`: This prop defines the text font weight of the Table cells. The default is `normal`.
- `headerTextColor`: This prop defines the text color of the Table header. The default is `white`.
- `headerTextTransform`: This prop defines the text transform of the Table header. The default is `uppercase`.
- `headerTextFontWeight`: This prop defines the text font weight of the Table header. The default is `bolder`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Customized Table" args={{ data: [
            { id: 12, name: 'Harry', Age: 17 },
            { id: 2, name: 'Ron', Age: 18 },
            { id: 1, name: 'Hermione', Age: 18 },
            { id: 14, name: 'Ginny', Age: 17 },
            { id: 15, name: 'Luna', Age: 15 },
            { id: 16, name: 'Sirius', Age: 35 },
            { id: 17, name: 'Hagrid', Age: 80 },
            { id: 18, name: 'Albus', Age: 116 },
        ], pageSize: "5", headerTextColor: "#f0acb5", cellTextTransform: "lowercase", height: "450px" }}>
        {CustomizedTable.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

The `Table component` comes with a lot of options for customization, with this options you are in full control of how you want to display your data.

In the above example we have used the `headerTextColor` prop to change the text color of the header.
We have also used the `cellTextTransform` prop to change the text transform of the cell to lowercase
from capitalize which is the default value. I have also used the `height` prop to change the height of
the Table to `450px`.

## Other Props & Functionalities

For a full breakdown of all the additional props, refer to the Table below. There are many
amazing props like `pageNum` which can be used to extend the functionality of the Table.
