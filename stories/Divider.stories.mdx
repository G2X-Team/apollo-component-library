	- [Styling](#styling)
- [Other Props & Functionalities](#other-props--functionalities)

## Functionality

Functionally this component will render a divider with the given `color` and `height`.
This will work as a separator between content for the user.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Standard Divider" args={{ color: 'lightgray', height: '1' }}>
		{StandardDivider.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### Styling

Divider comes with two props `'color'` & `'height'`. You can use these props to customize
the Divider based on where you want to use it. You just need to add the color you want the Divider to be and add a height as number.
> `'height'` prop takes a `px` value but you don't have to add the `px` just put the number and it will work fine.

Let's use these props to create a cool `red` Divider with a height of `5px`

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Divider Styling" args={{ color: 'red', height: '5' }}>
		{DividerStyling.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

Here take a look at the table below, it shows the two addtional props you can use with the Divider component.
The `'color'` prop will let you change the color of the Divider, while the `'height'` prop will let you increase or decrease
the height of the Divider.
