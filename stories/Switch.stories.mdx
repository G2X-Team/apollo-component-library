# Switch

Switch component is another boolean input component used to toggle between two states. It is mostly used in mobile devices and gives a rich user experience.
The main difference between the Switch and the Checkbox is that the Switch is not used in a set of options rather it is used as an individual element.

## Table of Contents

In this documentation we talk about the Switch component in depth about its usage and its props.

## Functionality

Functionally Switch has two states - checked and unchecked. Thanks to the `checked` prop, you can control
the state of the Switch. It also comes with a `name` prop, that can be used to difrentiate between multiple Switch Options.
By using the `children` prop, you can pass a label to the Switch.

Let's have a look at at a simple Switch with `name` & `children` props:

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Standard Switch" args={{ children: 'This is a Switch'}}>
		{StandardSwitch.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### Switch States

As mentioned above the the Switch comes with tqo states - checked and unchecked, and these states can be controlled by the `checked` prop.
Let's look at both of these states:

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Switch States" args={{ children: 'This is a Switch'}}>
		{SwitchStates.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled Switch

With the `disabled` prop, you can disable the Switch. This will prevent the user from interacting with the Switch.
Here we can see that we have two disabled Switch Options, one is checked and one is unchecked.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Disabled Switch" args={{ children: 'This is a Switch', disabled: true }}>
		{DisabledSwitch.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Variants

Switch comes in two styling variant that can be accessed by the `variant` prop. The default variant is `default` and the other variant is `secondary`.

Let's have a look at at a both the Switch variants:

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Switch Variant" args={{ children: 'This is a Switch',}}>
		{StandardSwitch.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>
