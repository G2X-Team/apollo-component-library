## Functionality

The Modal component comes with a ton of features and functionality. We have listed a few of the most important features below to get you started.
Please have look:

- The Modal component renders its children inside of a backdrop component.
- This captures the user's attention and prevents the user from interacting with the rest of the page until the Modal is closed.
- The Modal can be closed by clicking the cross icon on top of the `header` or pressing the escape key.
- The Modal component comes with two types `Standard Modal` and `Alert Modal`.
- You can use multiple Modals at a time to create a stack of modals.

### `Standard Modal`

A standard simple Modal works like a wrapper inside a backdrop component with `header`, `footer` and `text` as its
children elements. It comes with an `toggleModal` method to open the modal. Here in the example below we are using a
button component with an onclick event to fire the `toggleModal` method.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Modal" args={{  }}>
        {StandardModal.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### `Alert Modal`

In the below example we are using the `alert` prop to set the Modal to an `Alert Modal`.
`Alert Modal` is a special type of Modal that can't be closed using `Escape` key.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Alert Modal" args={{ alert:true }}>
        {AlertModal.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### `Buttons Group`

Models can have multiple buttons in the footer. You can use the `ButtonGroup` component to group buttons together. These buttons can be used to close the modal.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Buttons Group" args={{}}>
        {ButtonsGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
