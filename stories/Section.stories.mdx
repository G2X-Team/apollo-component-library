# Section

The Section component works like a flexbox container with a fixed `width` and `height`. It can be used to create a layout for your components.
It is one of the most useful component to have. It is highly customizable thanks to dozens of props.

## Table of Contents

In this documentation we talk about the Section component, it's functionality and props.

    - [Styling Section](#styling-section)
    - [Navigation Section](#navigation-section)
- [Other Props & Functionalities](#other-props--functionalities)

## Functionality

The main idea behind the section component is to create a container with the properties to alter its items' width/height position to best fill the available space in order to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes.
You have full control over the responsive design of the Section component, so they can look great on mobile devices as well as in large format on a desktop.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Section" args={{ flex: '1',
        height: '100',
        width: '100',
        minWidth: '1',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center', }}>
        {StandardSection.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>


### Styling Section

In this example we will use `flex` prop to create a Section with where the `Red` is bigger then the `Blue` column. To do this we just have to change the `flex` prop value from the default 1 to whatever you like, in the example below we have changed it to 4.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Styling Section" args={{ flex: '4',
        height: '100',
        width: '100',
        minWidth: '1',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center', }}>
        {StylingSection.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>


### Navigation Section

In this example we will use the `navigation` prop to determine if the Section is a navigation bar. Turning the `navigation` prop `True` will compress to a hamburger given it shrinks past its min-width.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Navigation Section" args={{ flex: '1',
        height: '100',
        width: '100',
        minWidth: '750px',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center', }}>
        {NavigationSection.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
